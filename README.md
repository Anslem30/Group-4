# Group-4
SEM Project.
Project Overview:
The project involves designing and implementing a reporting system using C# and MySQL to provide easy access to population information from the world database. The system will generate various reports, including population data for countries, cities, and capital cities, and provide statistics on language speakers. The project will be managed using Scrum methodology, with specific roles assigned to team members and tasks tracked using GitHub and Zube.io.

Key System Requirements
Report Generation:
Countries, cities, and capital cities organized by population:
All countries, cities, and capital cities in the world, by continent, and by region, organized by largest population to smallest.
Specific columns for each report type.
Top N populated countries, cities, and capital cities:
User-defined top N populated countries, cities, and capital cities globally, by continent, and by region.
Population breakdown by continent, region, country, and city:
Total population, population living in cities, and population not living in cities.
Language speaker’s statistics:
Number of people speaking Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, and Arabic, including the percentage of the world population.
Data Access:

Population data at different levels: world, continent, region, country, district, and city.
Population living in cities versus not living in cities.
Project Implementation Plan
Initial Setup:

Set up a GitHub repository for version control.
Create and maintain a Kanban board on Zube.io for task tracking.
Download and set up the world database in MySQL.
Sprint 1: Initial Reports:

Initialize a C# project and set up database connectivity.
Implement reports for all countries, cities, and capital cities organized by population.
Sprint 2: Advanced Reports and Top N Queries:

Implement top N populated reports for countries, cities, and capital cities.
Develop methods for population breakdown reports.
Sprint 3: Language Speaker’s Statistics and Population Data Access:

Implement language speaker’s statistics reports.
Provide methods to access population data at different levels and compare populations living in cities versus not living in cities.
Sprint 4: Finalization and Testing:

Refine all reports based on feedback.
Perform comprehensive testing of all functionalities.
Finalize documentation and prepare for project presentation.
Team Roles and Responsibilities
Product Owner: Decides the features and development order.
Scrum Master: Guides the team in following Scrum, resolves issues, and maintains team efficiency.
Development Team: Builds the system according to the Product Owner's requirements using C#.
Project Management Tools
GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
Zube.io: For Kanban board and task management.
Unit Testing and Documentation: To ensure code quality and maintainability.
By following this detailed plan and adhering to Scrum methodology, the team aims to build an efficient and user-friendly system that meets all the specified requirements for population reporting and data access.
